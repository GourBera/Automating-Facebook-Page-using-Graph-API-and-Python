The proposed system will analyze all Posts and Comments posted on any Facebook Page and store all related data in centralized database. 

Then it will take each post/comment and analyze the Sentiment(Polarity) of that Post/Comments and store the result(Polarity score) in database. 

Then based on the result(if negative) it will send a mail to the concerned person inorder to provide some immediate response  

Using this application we will be able to find out all related data about posts and comments and will be able to take decision based on that.  

You can deploy the code in AWS or any other cloud based system as well very easily
